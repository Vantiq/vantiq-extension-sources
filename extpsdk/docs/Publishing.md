# Publishing the Vantiq Connector SDK

The Vantiq Python Connector SDK is configured to use the standard Python [`setuptools`](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) package for building distributions, and [`twine`](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) for publishing to a Python Package Index.  [`Gradle`](https://gradle.org) is used to initiate this action.

## Configuration

Before publishing the SDK, you must determine the destination to which you wish to publish (see the next section) and the version to publish. The versions used are governed by the rules outlined in [PEP 440 â€“ Version Identification and Dependency Specification](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). We generally use the major, minor, and micro components components (_major.minor.micro_).  See the [specification](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) (specifically the [Final Releases](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#final-releases) section) for details.

To set these versions, set the `gradle` property `vantiqConnectorSdkVersion` to the value desired.  This is generally done via the command line `-P` flag (_e.g._, `-PvantiqConnectorSdkVersion=1.2.3`) but could be done using the `gradle.properties` file.

## Setting up the Publishing Environment

To set up the environment to publish, you will need an account on the Python Package Index servers to which you intend to publish.  To configure this access, set up your `.pypirc` file as described [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/).

By default, the `gradle` files are configured to publish to a repository named `testpypi` as named in the `.pypirc` file. To use publish to a different repository, add the `gradle` property `pypi_repo` to the command line.  For example, to publish version 1.2.3 to a repo named _myPypiRepo_, use the command

```shell
    gradle -PvantiqConnectorSdkVersion=1.2.3 -Ppypi_repo=myPypiRepo publish
```

This assumes that your `.pypirc` file contains at least the following:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    myPypiRepo

[myPypiRepo]
repository = <url to which to publish for this repo>
username = <user name as appropriate for the repo>
password = <access token or password>
```
